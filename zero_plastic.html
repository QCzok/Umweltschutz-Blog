            <h2>Zero Plastic</h2>
            <p>
                If you wanted, well, pretty much anything, there are about a zillion companies that would happily
                bring it to you right this minute. It’d probably be delivered by a series of transportation methods,
                by plane, train, or truck, and when it arrives, it would almost definitely come in a big box full of
                plastic or Styrofoam.

                To many, these companies are a revelation. But as Amazon and the thousands of other businesses built
                around bringing you stuff have exploded in growth, they’ve been met with the same chorus of
                complaints: They create way, way too much trash. And one of the loudest voices has come from the
                zero-waste movement, a consumer-led, grassroots group of individuals and businesses coming for the
                convenience economy.

                The goal: Create as little garbage as possible. Recycling isn’t enough — only 9 percent of all
                plastic waste on Earth has been recycled. Among all the adherents of the zero- and low-waste
                lifestyle I spoke to, the first and foremost tenet is preventing waste from existing in the first
                place.

                Although its current iteration may have begun out of individual interest, over the past few years a
                growing number of zero-waste stores have sprouted up around across the country and around the world,
                helping both businesses and customers prevent garbage from ending up in landfills. Now, even major
                brands and cities are joining in, and it’s not all that difficult to understand why.

                It’s no coincidence that the popularity of zero-waste lifestyles happens to coincide with mounting
                evidence that climate change will be the defining event of this century. We’ve also only just begun
                to seriously research the effect of the staggering amount of plastic in our oceans — the first
                comprehensive count of it by Science just three years ago reported anywhere between 4.7 and 12.8
                million metric tons of ocean plastic. Plastic, in modern life, is nearly inescapable — simply
                washing our clothing, about 60 percent of which is now made of synthetic plastic fibers — releases
                hundreds of thousands of fibers into the water supply. Waste on dry land isn’t any better: The
                Environmental Protection Agency estimates that 23 percent of landfill waste comes from packaging and
                containers.

                In response to these bleak realities, we’re often told that it’s all our fault. Because you didn’t
                bring your reusable tote bag to Trader Joe’s, that polar bear is now dead. This is a lie, of course
                — the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issued a damning report that revealed just 100
                companies are responsible for 71 percent of global climate emissions, most of them oil and gas
                companies like ExxonMobil, Shell, and BP. But it would also be a lie to claim that online shopping
                isn’t terrible for the environment — in 2016, transportation overtook power plants as the top
                producer of carbon dioxide emissions in the US, with a quarter of that coming from medium- and
                heavy-duty delivery trucks.

                So what’s an environmentally conscious consumer to do? Well, if you’re on the more extreme end of
                the spectrum, a natural response might be to try and fit all your garbage for an entire year in a
                single jar. This, at least, was the strategy used by Bea Johnson after her family of four downsized
                to a small apartment in downtown San Francisco in 2006. Once she realized that they hardly missed 80
                percent of the items that were put in storage, Johnson started a blog in 2009 that ultimately got
                her a profile in the New York Times (headline: “A Visit From the Priestess of Waste-Free Living”).

                “The comments in that article were absolutely nasty,” she says, laughing, “which is understandable,
                because people did not know what a zero-waste lifestyle was. I must say myself, if I had heard about
                a zero-waste family 15 years ago, I would have thought, ‘these people are hippies.’”

                Yet today, Johnson has a book, a couple of TED Talks, and a nearly 200,000-strong Instagram
                following; plus, she says she and her family are healthier and save around 40 percent of their
                overall budget thanks to their frugal shopping habits. As for what’s in those jars at the end of the
                year, exactly? Stickers on produce, caulking from the back of the sink, a piece of duct tape that
                got stuck on somebody’s shoe, and a filter from the gutters that flew off in the wind. “Really,
                things that you don’t have a name for,” she says.

                The visual of a year’s worth of garbage in a jar is a clever gimmick, which is likely why it spread
                to others across the country. There’s Lauren Singer, who managed to fit four years’ of trash in a
                single 16-ounce jar and opened Package Free Shop in Brooklyn, and Auri Jackson, who in 2016 produced
                and starred in a viral BuzzFeed video in which she went waste-free for 30 days.
